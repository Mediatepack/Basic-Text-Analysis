Hi, how are you today?  I hope you are having an amazing day!
I can not remember my name anymore.  I bet it was because I got hit in the head at the baseball game; However, I did get to walk and go to first base.  Baseball really is a fun game.
I also love to code.  It is super fun and really rewarding once you get your program finished, but testing for bugs is always the long and boring part that must be done.
I hope you have an amazing day.           Please be careful out there it can get dangerous!
